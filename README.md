# Shape Detection Practice

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and associated image files for practicing shape detection algorithms.

## Overview

The `deteccionFiguras.ipynb` notebook includes code and methodology for detecting basic geometric shapes like circles, triangles, and squares from images. The notebook is designed as a practical exercise for understanding the concepts of image processing and shape detection in computer vision.

## Contents

- `deteccionFiguras.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the shape detection code and explanations.
- `img/`: Directory containing sample images used by the notebook.
  - `circulo.jpeg`: Image of a circle used for detection.
  - `triangle.jpg`: Image of a triangle used for detection.
  - `cuadrado.jpg`: Image of a square used for detection.
 
## Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Details on required libraries can be found within the notebook.

## Usage

Each image file in the `img/` directory is used within the notebook to demonstrate the shape detection techniques. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to see the algorithms in action.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request if you have improvements or additional features you'd like to add.
